Guided decision making AI for 0 A.D.

Created out of an interesting discussion in the world wide forum by blargin3, agentx, wraitii & Hephaestion (Radagast).


An effort to not improve but vary over the bots:

- qBot (by Quantumstate, based on TestBot).
- Marilyn (by Wraitii, itself based on qBot).
- TauCeti (by Wraitii, built upon the qBot and Marilyn).



======= Limitations =======
- Saving is not yet fully supported and may result in idle workers or buildings.
- Siege and defensive in general are limited structures.


======= Install =======
Requires: common-api:
Install by placing files into the data/mods/public/simulation/ai/aegis folder.



======= Debug =======
You may want to set "debug : true" in common-api/config.js if you are developping, you will get a better understanding of what the AI does. There are also many commented debug outputs, and many commented map outputs that you may want to uncomment.



======= History =======

TauCeti bot has been made default as of Alpha 13. It features some technological support, early naval support, better economic management, better defense and better attack management (over qBot). It is generally much stronger than the former, and should hopefully be able to handle more situations properly. It is, however, not faultless.

Please report any error to the wildfire games forum ( http://www.wildfiregames.com/forum/index.php?act=idx ), and thanks for testing our history recreation!
